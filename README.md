This github account was created for my internship, but now I am using it for a wakeTech assignment.

I created this repository for my lesson 05 GitHub lab. It includes just a README.md file.

To clone this repository on my pc, I first had to install GitHub desktop and click the clone repository button in the top left. I then chose which repository I wanted cloned (jamisonricks.github.io) and clicked clone repository.

# About Me
## My Interests
Some things I am interested include video games, books, and anime. I love letting myself get immersed into a fictional world. Some of my favorite video games include Kingdom Hearts 2, Hollow Knight, and Celeste.
## Websites I reccomend
[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) - Youtube is one of my favorite webistes simply for the variety of content you can watch on it. Somme of my favorite videos to watch are long video essays on topics I don't know much about.  
[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) - Amazon is also one of my most visited sites simply for the amount of different products you can buy from it. At this point, I'd say about 80% of the things I buy (besides food or gas) come from amazon.
