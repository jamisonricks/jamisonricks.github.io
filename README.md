This github account was created for my internship, but now I am using it for a wakeTech assignment.

I created this repository for my lesson 05 GitHub lab. It includes just a README.md file.

To clone this repository on my pc, I first had to install GitHub desktop and click the clone repository button in the top left. I then chose which repository I wanted cloned (jamisonricks.github.io) and clicked clone repository.
